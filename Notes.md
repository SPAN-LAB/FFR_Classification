# Notes 
The 

ROC curve and confusion matrix in the GUI 
plot the ffr waveforms for each person across each stimuli 

plot grand average 
    on the grand average, plot the individual subjects as a thin line 
    title comes from raw labels, not the label it is mapped to 

Whenever click on subaveraging 
    two options: 
    1. subaveraging fixed size 
    2. subaveraging variable size 
        when looking at many different iterations of subaveraging fixed size 
        add label that this is slower, add stride:  min, max, increments 
        -> users can use the best value 

    when hovering over a subaveraging result, pop up the confusion matrix and ROC curve 

    ROC 
        sensitivity (correctlty identifying the right class ) / 1 - specificyt (correctly rejecting the wrong class )
